Only Timetable is a flexible, plugin-based timetable application for bus and other public transport systems. The name "Only Timetable" reflects the app's purpose: it is the **ONLY** app you need for bus and public transport timetables, and it is focused **ONLY** on providing timetable information. There are no distractions‚Äîjust the essential features for managing and viewing transport schedules. The core app does not include any routes or ETA data by default; all transport information is provided via plugins. This design allows support for any bus company or region simply by adding or developing the appropriate plugin.

## Features

1. **Plugin-based, Extensible & Marketplace:** Easily extend support to new transport providers or regions by adding plugins. Discover, install, and manage plugins directly within the app using the built-in Plugin Marketplace. The app is designed to be minimal and adaptable, with all timetable data provided by plugins, and the marketplace makes it easy to find and update plugins for any transport provider or region.
